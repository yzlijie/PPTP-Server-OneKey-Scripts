Setup Simple PPTP VPN server for CentOS and Ubuntu
==================================================

> NOTE: PPTP VPN is considered insecure. Do not rely for this vpn
> if you need security. However, PPTP works out of the box on many
> operating systems, including many Linux distributions, Windows, 
> Mac OS and Android and it's easily good enough for evading country
> level IP blocks.

Some notes
==========
If your vpn password **less than 8** characters,then give you a random password.

To add more accounts, see the file /etc/ppp/chap-secrets

If you keep the vpn server generated with this script on the internet for a
long time (days or more), consider either restricting access to the ssh port on
the server by ip addresses to the networks you use, if you know the addresses
you are most likely to use or at least change ssh from port 22 to a random
port.

You can also specify you own username and password, run `./CentOS-pptp-setup.sh -h`
*or* `sudo bash Ubuntu-pptp-setup.sh -h` for help.
